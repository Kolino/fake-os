# Fake iPhone OS App

Working link: https://keelan-black-fake-os.netlify.app

## Description
This is an SPA (single page application) that is written using HTML, SASS, and vanilla JS with the goal of mimicking an old iPhone OS.

## How to Run
Simply download the repo and run index.html in the browser.

## How to Use
All the apps in the app are just images except for the last three displayed on the home screen- 'Convert', 'To Do', and 'Coin Flip'.
To use any of these three working apps, just click them to open them. To return to the home screen, use the back arrow at the top of the app's page.
